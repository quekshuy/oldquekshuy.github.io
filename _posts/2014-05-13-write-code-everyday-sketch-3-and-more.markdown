Just an update of what I'm up to:

* __Writing code everyday__

I think writing code everyday is hard. In the original blog post, it recommends to do 30 mins a day. I think 1 commit a day would be hard, but that might mean my commits touch too many files.

* __Sketch 3__

[It's pretty amazing.](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/)

A little pricier than what I hoped for but I'd fork out money to try it out. Just like I paid USD$19 for Pixelmator, which I think has been one of the best purchases I've made so far on the Mac App Store. I mean Photoshop is great but I'm just not going to fork out thousands just to make quick edits. 

Also I haven't gotten the bezier curve thing done so far.
