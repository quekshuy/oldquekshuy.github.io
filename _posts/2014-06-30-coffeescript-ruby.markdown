I've been working with Coffeescript recently.

I haven't done much reading up on how it was designed, what its roots and the background of its authors' is, but the similarities in syntax between Coffeescript and Ruby are just plain.

If you're a purist, maybe you should stay away. But if you just want to get things done, then it doesn't matter.
