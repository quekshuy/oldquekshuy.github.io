title: Vox over Wikipedia

Wikipedia is becoming the grand ol&#039; dame when it comes to internet<br />
references. Sure its [reputation as a credible source is coming under fire](<br />
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedia_controversies#2014) but<br />
there is no authority in the world that does not get itself embroiled in<br />
some kind of controversy unless it operates at the top level in a<br />
dictatorial, oppressive environment.<br />
<br />
But for the issues that matter _right now_, the ones that the news reports<br />
where the facts are still being gathered and the story live-updated,<br />
Wikipedia is not going be able to give you the lowdown. Wikipedia is<br />
history documented (I&#039;m talking about events, not about concepts like &quot;what<br />
is a quicksort?&quot;), the media is where history unfolds.<br />
<br />
The latter space is where I think [Vox](http://www.vox.com) is doing well.<br />
<br />
Vox is a newly launched media outlet, much-hyped about because of a strong<br />
editorial/journalistic stuff with the likes of Ezra Klein, etc. It belongs<br />
to a family of topic-focused news sources such as [SBNation](<br />
http://www.sbnation.com) and [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com), which<br />
are fast gaining popularity. The cornerstone of Vox Media, the parent<br />
company for the aforementioned, is its technology. [They wrote a CMS called<br />
Chorus, which has its fair share of plaudits.](<br />

<br />
One of the reasons I like Vox is its Cards. Cards are stacks of distilled<br />
information giving overviews of the latest in the news that matters (at<br />
least from an American news[wo]man&#039;s perspective). For example, we&#039;re just<br />
done with the Indian elections and Narendra Modi&#039;s BJP Party just won.<br />
[Here is the Cards deck for that on Vox.](<br />
http://www.vox.com/cards/narendra-modi/who-is-narendra-modi). It&#039;s got all<br />
the information that you require to understand at least the bulk of the<br />
issues that provide a backdrop and an accompanying commentary to this man&#039;s<br />
election to power.<br />
<br />
We need this in the avalanche of information generated in today&#039;s media. We<br />
need an agent to cut through the partisanship and political bias. Young<br />
adults, fledglings to the world of media, need the facts to form their own<br />
opinion. News outlets need a voice, because they provide thought<br />
leadership. People identify with the newspapers they read. Lots of<br />
ultra-conservatives identify with Fox News for example. But is that what we<br />
need in the world today? In a world where access to a public Internet is<br />
actually a doorway to more ignorance? It&#039;s like the Internet is a tool for<br />
more enlightenment only if you have the necessary discipline to negotiate<br />
the dangers it is fraught with, dangers like extreme opinions,<br />
close-mindedness masquerading as righteousness, discrimination and just<br />
all-round uncivilised behaviour. I for one enjoy a good rollicking in the<br />
comments section of a Yahoo News segment but is that what the upcoming<br />
generation needs? Or do they need to first know the facts then form their<br />
opinion and find the voice online that resonates?<br />
<br />
While I am in no position to comment on the quality of writing and<br />
journalism on Vox, I do think that its thoughtfulness with regard to the<br />
issues, evidence-based reporting I guess, is the way to go in a mediascape<br />
filled with knee-jerk sensationalism.
