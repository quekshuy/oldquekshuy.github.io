Wikipedia is becoming the grand ol' dame when it comes to internet references. Sure its [reputation as a credible source is coming under fire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedia_controversies#2014) but there is no authority in the world that does not get itself embroiled in some kind of controversy unless it operates at the top level in a dictatorial, oppressive environment.

But for the issues that matter _right now_, the ones that the news reports where the facts are still being gathered and the story live-updated, Wikipedia is not going be able to give you the lowdown. Wikipedia is history documented (I'm talking about events, not about concepts like "what is a quicksort?"), the media is where history unfolds.

The latter space is where I think [Vox](http://www.vox.com) is doing well. 

Vox is a newly launched media outlet, much-hyped about because of a strong editorial/journalistic stuff with the likes of Ezra Klein, etc. It belongs to a family of topic-focused news sources such as [SBNation](http://www.sbnation.com) and [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com), which are fast gaining popularity. The cornerstone of Vox Media, the parent company for the aforementioned, is its technology. [They wrote a CMS called Chorus, which has its fair share of plaudits.](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/business/media/voxcom-takes-melding-of-journalism-and-technology-to-next-level.html) 

One of the reasons I like Vox is its Cards. Cards are stacks of distilled information giving overviews of the latest in the news that matters (at least from an American news[wo]man's perspective). For example, we're just done with the Indian elections and Narendra Modi's BJP Party just won. [Here is the Cards deck for that on Vox.](http://www.vox.com/cards/narendra-modi/who-is-narendra-modi). It's got all the information that you require to understand at least the bulk of the issues that provide a backdrop and an accompanying commentary to this man's election to power. 

We need this in the avalanche of information generated in today's media. We need an agent to cut through the partisanship and political bias. Young adults, fledglings to the world of media, need the facts to form their own opinion. News outlets need a voice, because they provide thought leadership. People identify with the newspapers they read. Lots of ultra-conservatives identify with Fox News for example. But is that what we need in the world today? In a world where access to a public Internet is actually a doorway to more ignorance? It's like the Internet is a tool for more enlightenment only if you have the necessary discipline to negotiate the dangers it is fraught with, dangers like extreme opinions, close-mindedness masquerading as righteousness, discrimination and just all-round uncivilised behaviour. I for one enjoy a good rollicking in the comments section of a Yahoo News segment but is that what the upcoming generation needs? Or do they need to first know the facts then form their opinion and find the voice online that resonates?

While I am in no position to comment on the quality of writing and journalism on Vox, I do think that its thoughtfulness with regard to the issues, evidence-based reporting I guess, is the way to go in a mediascape filled with kneejerk sensationalism.
