I saw [this](http://devblog.avdi.org/2010/08/02/using-and-and-or-in-ruby/).

I think it's a mistake.

When a language that has two things that __semantically__ should mean the same, but don't, then we're obviously in some murky territory.

Ruby is not the right language for novice programmers. Definitely not.
