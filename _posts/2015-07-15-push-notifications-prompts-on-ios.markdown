According to [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20374801/push-notification-on-or-off-checking-in-ios), if youâ€™ve disabled push notifications for an app when prompted, you will not be asked again unless you uninstall it and reinstall it after at least a day.

It makes sense but at the same time, so troublesome for testing.
