According to [this](\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/20374801/push-notification-on-or-off-checking-in-ios),\nif youâ€™ve disabled push notifications for an app when prompted, you will\nnot be asked again unless you uninstall it and reinstall it after at least\na day.\n\nIt makes sense but at the same time, so troublesome for testing.
